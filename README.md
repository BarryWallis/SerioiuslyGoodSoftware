# SerioiuslyGoodSoftware
Examples, exercises and work from Seriously Good Software by Marco Faella published by Manning. 

Although the examples in the book are in Java, I implemented them in C# with the following changes:
1) Updated them so they complied with my code style (e.g., i the Novice project I deleted the x field and replaced it with the Amount auto-property). 
2) Changed the Java get / put methods to properties (e.g., changed getAmount to the property Amount).
